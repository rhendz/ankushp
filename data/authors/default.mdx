Welcome to my corner of the web! I'm glad you stumbled upon my site, adventurer! Here, you'll get a glimpse into who I am and what I'm passionate about. Feel free to explore my [blog](https://ankushp.com/blog/), where I share insights into both my professional journey and my diverse array of interests. And if you're interested in learning more about my professional background, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankush-p/).

My academic journey began at the University of Tennessee, where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics. Building on that foundation, I pursued a Master's degree in Computer Science at [TENNLab](https://neuromorphic.eecs.utk.edu/), a cutting-edge research group dedicated to revolutionizing computing through insights from the human brain. During my time there, I delved into the fascinating realm of neuromorphic algorithms, tackling challenges such as 3D navigation and LiDAR-based object detection. Working with Intel's Loihi, a specialized neuromorphic research chip, was a particularly enriching experience.

In my career, I've been fortunate to work across various domains, honing a diverse skill set along the way. At [Potify](https://tickle.utk.edu/ut-students-develop-app-aimed-at-warning-city-about-potholes/), a startup I co-founded, we developed and deployed a pothole management application, facilitating Knoxville's transition to a modern, mobile-based work order system. During an internship at AT&T, I engineered a robust NoSQL Cassandra database API, enabling real-time audits for vast datasets. My short tenure at Meta involved building a GraphQL API in PHP to streamline branded content creation. Most recently, I contributed to [Spice](https://www.spice.cloud/), where we leveraged AI to develop an innovative image editing tool, tackling tasks ranging from text-to-image conversion to inpainting.

Proficient in Python, C++, and JavaScript, I thrive on tackling complex challenges and pushing the boundaries of technology. Outside the realm of work, you'll often find me leading an active lifestyle, whether it's hitting the gym 🏋️‍♂️, skiing down slopes 🎿, or exploring the depths while scuba diving 🤿. I'm a passionate foodie who loves discovering new restaurants 🍽️, and I enjoy capturing moments through photography 📸 during my travels. Given the time, I'd love to reignite my passion for Brazilian jiu-jitsu 🥋, delve into the world of e-commerce 💼, and capture the beauty of the cosmos through astrophotography 🌌.

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy the journey through my world!
