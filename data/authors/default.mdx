# Welcome to My Corner of the Web!

I’m thrilled you’ve found your way here, adventurer! 🧭

Feel free to dive into my [blog](https://ankushp.com/blog/), where I explore my professional journey and a variety of interests that inspire me. If you’d like to know more about my professional background, let’s connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankush-p/).

## Academic Journey

My academic journey began at the University of Tennessee, where I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Mathematics. From there, I pursued a Master’s degree in Computer Science at [TENNLab](https://neuromorphic.eecs.utk.edu/), a leading research group focused on transforming computing through insights from the human brain. My research included neuromorphic algorithms for 3D navigation and LiDAR-based object detection, and I had the incredible opportunity to work with Intel's Loihi, a cutting-edge neuromorphic research chip.

## Professional Experience

I’ve had the privilege of contributing to diverse projects across multiple domains:

- As a co-founder of [Potify](https://tickle.utk.edu/ut-students-develop-app-aimed-at-warning-city-about-potholes/), I helped develop and deploy a pothole tracking app that modernized Knoxville's work order system.
- At AT&T, I designed a NoSQL Cassandra database API to enable real-time audits of massive datasets.
- During my time at Meta, I built a GraphQL API to streamline branded content creation.
- Most recently, I’ve worked on projects that bring machine learning into production, creating scalable systems and enabling groundbreaking experiences.

## Skills and Interests

I specialize in backend and MLOps, with proficiency in:

- Designing scalable microservices with **Traefik**, **Kong**, and **Docker**.
- Building CI/CD pipelines and automating model lifecycles with **GitHub Actions**, **RabbitMQ**, and **MLflow**.
- Deploying optimized machine learning models using **PyTorch**, **ONNX**, and **Azure**.

When I’m not working, you’ll likely find me:

- At the gym 🏋️‍♂️, skiing 🎿, or scuba diving 🤿.
- Exploring new restaurants 🍽️ or capturing moments through photography 📸 during my travels.

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoyed the brief glimpse into my world! Feel free to reach out—I’d love to hear from you!
