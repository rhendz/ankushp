# Welcome to My Corner of the Web!

I’m thrilled you’ve found your way here, adventurer! 🧭

Feel free to dive into my [blog](https://ankushp.com/blog/), where I explore my professional journey and a variety of interests that inspire me. If you’d like to know more about my professional background, let’s connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankush-p/).

## Academic Journey

My academic journey began at the University of Tennessee, where I earned a **Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Mathematics**. From there, I pursued a **Master’s degree in Computer Science** at [TENNLab](https://neuromorphic.eecs.utk.edu/), a leading research group focused on transforming computing through insights from the human brain. My research included neuromorphic algorithms for **3D navigation and LiDAR-based object detection**, and I had the opportunity to work with Intel's **Loihi**, a cutting-edge neuromorphic research chip.

## Professional Experience

I’ve had the privilege of contributing to diverse projects across startups, enterprise, and research:

- As a co-founder of [Potify](https://tickle.utk.edu/news/ut-students-develop-app-aimed-at-warning-city-about-potholes/), I helped develop and deploy a pothole tracking app that modernized Knoxville's work order system.
- At AT&T, I designed a NoSQL Cassandra database API to enable real-time audits of massive datasets.
- At Meta, I built a GraphQL API to streamline branded content creation, automating **5,000+ requests per day**.
- At Spice Cloud Labs, I scaled **distributed LoRA fine-tuning** across 100+ nodes and deployed **Stable Diffusion pipelines** with 99.9% uptime.
- At Sequels AI, I designed microservices and **real-time inference systems** (YOLO, ONNX) for AI-driven content delivery.
- Most recently at Coinbase, I’ve built global-scale compliance systems impacting **100M+ users**, including **real-time risk pipelines** and **agent-driven developer tooling**.

## Skills and Interests

I specialize in **backend and systems engineering with an AI focus**, including:

- Designing scalable microservices with **Traefik**, **Kong**, **Docker**, and **FastAPI**.
- Building pipelines and automating workflows with **Airflow**, **GitHub Actions**, **RabbitMQ**, and **MLflow**.
- Deploying optimized machine learning models using **PyTorch**, **ONNX**, and cloud platforms like **AWS** and **Azure**.

When I’m not working, you’ll likely find me:

- Training in the gym 🏋️‍♂️, skiing 🎿, or scuba diving 🤿.
- Running long distances — most recently finishing a half marathon in **sub-1:45 (sub-8 min/mile pace)**.
- Exploring new restaurants 🍽️ or capturing moments through photography 📸.

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoyed this glimpse into my world. Feel free to reach out—I’d love to hear from you!
