As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting hues of pink and gold over the skyline of San Francisco, Sarah and Alex found themselves unwinding at their favorite bar after a
long day of work. Sarah sat slumped over her drink with frustration visibly evident on her face.

"Something on your mind, Sarah?" Alex asked, noticing her solemn expression.

Sarah sighed heavily. üòî "It's this darn model deployment issue.
We've been working on this AI project for months now, and every time we try to deploy the model onto our target device, it crashes.
The darn thing is just too large for the device to handle."

Alex nodded sympathetically, taking a sip of his beer. üç∫ "Yeah, I've heard that's been a common problem lately. But have you considered applying model compression techniques?"

Sarah raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "Model compression? What's that?" ü§î

Alex leaned in, a mischievous glint in his eye. "Oh, it's like magic, Sarah.
Model compression techniques allow you to shrink the size of your model without sacrificing performance.
It's all about pruning away unnecessary connections and parameters, kind of like trimming the fat off a steak." ‚ú®

Sarah's eyes widened with interest. "That sounds too good to be true. How does it work?"

"Well," Alex began, "there are several approaches to model compression, like pruning, quantization, and distillation.
Pruning involves removing redundant connections or parameters from the network, while quantization reduces the precision of numerical values.
And distillation transfers knowledge from a large, complex model to a smaller, simpler one."üí°

Sarah leaned back, processing this newfound information. "That sounds like it could be the solution to our deployment woes. Do you think we could give it a try?"

Alex grinned, raising his glass in a toast. "Absolutely, Sarah. With model compression,
we'll have that AI up and running on your device in no time. Here's to the magic of technology!" ü•Ç‚ú®

And as the clink of their glasses echoed through the bar,
Sarah couldn't help but feel a renewed sense of hope and excitement for the possibilities that model compression could unlock for their project. üåüüöÄ

# What is Model Compression?

**The Problem**

Modern models, especially those in
generative AI, can be _huge_. Oftentimes, these models are well within the domain of billions of parameters. Take for example a relatively small LLM: Llama-2-7b. A quick back-of-the-hand
calculation shows that loading this model into memory (assuming fp32) for inference requires significant resources:

$$
7*10^9*4 \text{B} * \frac{1 \text{GB}}{10^9 \text{B}} = 28\text{GB}
$$

This is not a problem if your system is backed by a large GPU data center, but what if it isn't? What if you wanted to deploy your model onto a resource-constrained device like a phone, embedded system, or edge device?
Attempting to do so may be impossible given the memory limits of the device. So what can we do?

**The Solution**

Fortunately for us, quite a few techniques have been developed under the umbrella of _model compression_ that seek to solve these issues.
In a nutshell, **model compression** refers to a set of techniques that are used to:

- Reduce memory footprint
- Increase inference speed
- Lower energy consumption
- Enable edge computing
- Save money üí∏

This post is the first in a series of posts that will seek to unravel various model compression techniques.
In this initial post, we will take a look at model compression techniques
from a bird's-eye view and compare the techniques. But first, it may help to build a mental image of what _model compression_ is.

This graphic shows us that we are effectively communicating the same image across various color depths,
but there is a tradeoff. 24-bit while nice, colorful, and _informative_, results in additional memory consumption.
In contrast, 1-bit while saving us a great deal of memory, may lose out on more intricate details.
