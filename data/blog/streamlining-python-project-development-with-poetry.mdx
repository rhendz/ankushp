summary: Using pyenv and poetry to streamline project development with an example
---

To pip or not to pip, that is the question. If you have worked with python projects, you may have
come across it's default package manager **pip**. Of course, there's nothing wrong with pip but it
can be lacking in certain areas:

- Limited dependency resolution in regard to complex dependency trees or conflicting version requirements
- Lack of dependency locking to ensure consistency across project installations
- Pip globally installs packages without using additional tools like `virtualenv`, leading to conflicting package versions across projects

Ok... so there may be a few things that are not so great about pip, but it is still a widely used tool in the Python
ecosystem and continues to evolve with improvements and community contributions. As you might have guessed,
**Poetry** is here to address these shortcomings and will be crucial in streamlining development
for your python projects.

## What is Poetry?

Now that we know what pip is and what some of its shortcomings are, we ask what is Poetry and how does it solve the issues faced with using pip as your package manager?

> Poetry is a python packaging and dependency management tool.

Poetry simplifies the process of managing your project by providing a centralized approach to defining, installing, and updating project dependencies.
In comparison, pip's dependency resolver may struggle with complex dependency trees or conflicting version requirements, potentially leading to installation issues or
project instability.

While pip indeed utilizes `requirements.txt` files for specifying dependencies, its capabilities are eclipsed by Poetry's utilization of `pyproject.toml`.
This file format not only allows for the declaration of dependencies but also facilitates the inclusion of detailed constraints and resolution logic.
By leveraging `pyproject.toml`, Poetry enables finer control over dependency versions, ensuring precise management and resolution.

Where pip traditionally installs packages globally, potentially leading to conflicts or dependency mismatches,
Poetry offers a more sophisticated approach. With Poetry, the creation and management of virtual environments are seamlessly integrated into the workflow,
ensuring that each project operates within its isolated environment.
This practice not only fosters consistency but also mitigates potential conflicts, providing a reliable foundation for development and deployment.

Furthermore, achieving seamless packaging and distribution of Python projects is not feasible with pip alone;
additional tooling and manual steps are typically required such as the usage of `setuptools`. Unlike Poetry, which provides built-in functionality for packaging projects,
pip lacks native support for creating distributable packages. Without the aid of additional tools or scripts,
developers using pip would need to resort to manual processes to package their projects, adding complexity and overhead to the development workflow.

Key features of Poetry:

- Centralized dependency management using `pyproject.toml`.
- Dependency resolution and lock files.
- Virtual environment management.
- Simplified package workflow.
- Versioning and publishing for packages.

While we won't delve into the packaging aspect of Poetry in this post, it's essential to recognize that Poetry offers robust capabilities beyond dependency management.
With Poetry, handling your favorite dependencies such as `numpy`, `pytorch`, and `matplotlib` becomes a seamless experience, thanks to its intuitive interface and powerful features.
By providing a centralized solution for managing dependencies,
Poetry streamlines the development workflow, enabling developers to focus on writing code rather than dealing with dependency issues.
By now, I trust you've discovered the convenience and efficiency that Poetry brings to Python project management! :)

## Installing pyenv

If you're confident that have Python installed efficiently, great you can skip this section! However, if you don't mind taking a quick
detour let's install **pyenv**. Just how _Poetry_ is used to manage our Python project's dependencies, we can use
_pyenv_ to simplify Python version management.

**Why pyenv?**

_pyenv_ simplifies managing multiple Python versions, enabling easy switching between them.
This is particularly useful for projects requiring different Python versions or compatibility testing across various versions.

If you're convinced, let's install pyenv!

### Linux/macOS

Run their automatic installer in your shell:

```bash
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

I'll show you how to setup your shell environment for pyenv so that it is available for use. Today, we'll continue with
using `bash` as our shell example. If you're unsure of what shell you have, check by using `echo $SHELL`. In the case it's `bash`, run the
following to modify `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'command -v pyenv >/dev/null || export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

For other shells and optionally adding pyenv to your login shell, please refer to [setting up your shell environment for pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#set-up-your-shell-environment-for-pyenv).

Now you can restart your shell by using `source ~/.bashrc` and then test out your pyenv installation by typing `pyenv`:

```text
pyenv 2.3.25
Usage: pyenv <command> [<args>]

Some useful pyenv commands are:
    --version Display the version of pyenv
    activate Activate virtual environment
    commands List all available pyenv commands
...
```

If you see something similar to above, we're ready to install python!
Let's install 3.12, which is the latest release at the time of writing this post and configure it as the global version:

```bash
pyenv install 3.12
pyenv global 3.12
pyenv version
```

### Windows

Unfortunately, pyenv does not officially support Windows outside of WSL. However, there is a [pyenv-win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win) fork that may be of interest.

For more information on installing pyenv and what it can do, checkout their github repo [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).

## Installing Poetry

Now that you have `pyenv`, we're ready to install Poetry!

### Linux/macOS

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

### Windows (Powershell)

```powershell
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | py -
```

That's it! You can test out your installation by typing `poetry --version`.

## Image Processing Toolkit (Example)

Let's say your a data scientist or a computer vision engineer working with images and you decided to build
your own image processing toolkit. In the first part, I'll show you how to initialize and install a _Poetry_
project from scratch. We will learn how to package and publish the toolkit in the second part. Third and last,
we will track dependencies, checking for outdated ones and updating if necessary.

### I. Initialization and Installation

We can use poetry to initialize our project:

```bash
poetry new image-processing-toolkit
```

This will generate the `image-processing-toolkit` directory with the following items:

```text
image-processing-toolkit/
|-- README.md
|-- image_processing_toolkit
|   `-- __init__.py
|-- pyproject.toml
`-- tests
    `-- __init__.py
```

Let's take a look at the internals of a Poetry project `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "image-processing-toolkit"
version = "0.1.0"
description = ""
authors = ["Ankush Patel <ap@ankushp.com>"]
readme = "README.md"

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.12"

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
```

Under `[tool.poetry]`, we have a few descriptors such as `name`, `version`, etc. defining common elements of our project.
Here, we can additionally specify your packages to include. For example, we can add `packages = [{include = "image-processing-toolkit"}]`, which
will contain the source files of our project.

Oftentimes, you will only want to use Poetry for dependency management. In this case, we can toggle the default package mode to off:

```toml
[tool.poetry]
package-mode = false
```

Note, Poetry has two operating modes: **package mode** (default) and **non-package mode**. Depending on which mode you use,
some fields become optional. See [pyproject](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/) for more details of what fields you can configure
in `pyproject.toml`.

In our case, we'll move forward with the default operating mode.

Before we design our image processing toolkit, it would be a good idea to add a few packages:

```bash
poetry add numpy opencv-python matplotlib
```

We can also add some developer dependencies to help improve our developer experience:

```bash
poetry add ruff pytest jupyter --group dev
```

`ruff` is an extremely fast Python linter and formatter written in Rust and `pytest` is a testing framework. Additionally,
we add `jupyter` to later add notebooks, showcasing examples of our image processing toolkit.

At this point, your `pyproject.toml` file should look something like this:

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "image-processing-toolkit"
version = "0.1.0"
description = ""
authors = ["Ankush Patel <ap@ankushp.com>"]
readme = "README.md"
packages = [{include = "image_processing_toolkit"}]

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.12"
numpy = "^1.26.4"
opencv-python = "^4.9.0.80"
matplotlib = "^3.8.3"

[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]
ruff = "^0.3.2"
pytest = "^8.1.1"
jupyter = "^1.0.0"

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
```

Although not entirely covered here, Poetry allows you to specify [version constraints](https://python-poetry.org/docs/dependency-specification/) for your dependencies.
Here the `python = "^3.12"` means versions `>=3.12.0 and <3.13.0` are allowed.

Before we install our poetry project, I recommend configuring Poetry to install our virtual environment `.venv` inside of our project.

```bash
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
poetry install
```

Note, if you would prefer the config setting to be per project, you can configure it in a `poetry.toml` file:

```toml
[virtualenvs]
create = true
in-project = true
```

Great! You have completed the first part of initializing and installing your _Poetry_ project. You can activate your virtual environment,
by typing `poetry shell` and you can run the following to confirm that you've installed everything correctly:

```bash
python -c "import image_processing_toolkit; print(image_processing_toolkit)"
```

If the above prints out the `image_processing_toolkit` module without errors, amazing! All that's left to do is build the toolkit, package, and publish!

### II. Packaging and Publishing

Since the point of this post is to demonstrate the usage of **Poetry**, we won't be too concerned about
the actual content of the project. Therefore, I went ahead and added the _source code_ under `image_processing_toolkit`, tests under `tests`,
and an `example.ipynb` under `notebooks`. There's also an additional `data` directory which contains an image used by `example.ipynb`, which you could
easily swap out with other images if you want to mess around with some of the functions.

You can also delete the project that we made in the first part, since we will be effectively cloning over the same project.
Go ahead and clone the Github repository and install it: [Image Processing Toolkit](https://github.com/rhendz/image-processing-toolkit).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rhendz/image-processing-toolkit.git
cd image-processing-toolkit
poetry install
```

You may have noticed a new file `poetry.lock`. This file is important for ensuring that every time you install dependencies, the exact versions specified in the lock
file are used. Furthermore, by _locking_ the dependencies we can ensure _reproducibility_ by maintaining an environment that is consistent
across different machines. Additionally, Poetry first checks the lock file to see if the required packages are
already installed, leading to faster dependency resolution.

Go ahead and run `poetry run pytest`, to make sure everything is installed and working correctly.

At this point, you should be able to run the jupyter notebook. There's three ways to do this, pick whichever you prefer:

1. Install the `Jupyter` extension in VSCode and select the `.venv` kernel.
2. Open `poetry shell` to activate your virtual environment and run `jupyter notebook`
3. Run `poetry run jupyter notebook`, which allows you to run comannds without activating your virtual environment.

Now that you've had some time to play around with the project, let's build and package our project to get it ready for distribution:

```bash
poetry build
```

You'll notice that a new distribution folder `dist` has been created containing our source distribution `image_processing_toolkit-0.1.0.tar.gz` and
wheels file `image_processing_toolkit-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`.

Now we can publish our work to PyPI, Python's official third-party software repository:

```bash
poetry config pypi-token.pypi <your-pypi-token>
poetry publish
```

Additionally, you can combine building and publishing in one step via `poetry publish --build`.

For more information on configuration, see [Making a PyPI API token](https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken).

### III. Tracking Dependencies

Let's go over a few useful commands that help _track_ your project's dependencies. For example, `poetry show` will show you
all the the packages installed by Poetry's runtime environment (including sub dependencies). If you're only interested in looking
at the the top-level dependencies i.e. those defined in the `pyproject.toml`, you can use `poetry show --top-level`.

If you want to view the dependency tree for a particular package say `matplotlib`, you can use `poetry show --tree matplotlib`:

```text
matplotlib 3.8.3 Python plotting package
├── contourpy >=1.0.1
│   └── numpy >=1.20,<2.0
├── cycler >=0.10
├── fonttools >=4.22.0
├── kiwisolver >=1.3.1
├── numpy >=1.21,<2
├── packaging >=20.0
├── pillow >=8
├── pyparsing >=2.3.1
└── python-dateutil >=2.7
    └── six >=1.5
```

Checking for outdated dependencies is as simple as using `poetry show --outdated` and to update them `poetry update` or `poetry update [<packages>...]` to
update specific packages.

As a bonus, you can use `poetry list` to see all available commands and `poetry <command> --help` to see specific details for a command.
