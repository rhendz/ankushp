summary: Using pyenv and poetry to streamline project development with an example
---

To pip or not to pip, that is the question. If you have worked with python projects, you may have
come across it's default package manager **pip**. Of course, there's nothing wrong with pip but it
can be lacking in certain areas:

- Limited dependency resolution in regard to complex dependency trees or conflicting version requirements
- Lack of dependency locking to ensure consistency across project installations
- Pip globally installs packages without using additional tools like `virtualenv`, leading to conflicting package versions across projects

Ok... so there may be a few things that are not so great about pip, but it is still a widely used tool in the Python
ecosystem and continues to evolve with improvements and community contributions. As you might have guessed,
**Poetry** is here to address these shortcomings and will be crucial in streamlining development
for your python projects.

## What is Poetry?

Now that we know what pip is and what some of its shortcomings are, we ask what is Poetry and how does it solve the issues faced with using pip as your package manager?

> Poetry is a python packaging and dependency management tool.

Poetry simplifies the process of managing your project by providing a centralized approach to defining, installing, and updating project dependencies.
In comparison, pip's dependency resolver may struggle with complex dependency trees or conflicting version requirements, potentially leading to installation issues or
project instability.

While pip indeed utilizes `requirements.txt` files for specifying dependencies, its capabilities are eclipsed by Poetry's utilization of `pyproject.toml`.
This file format not only allows for the declaration of dependencies but also facilitates the inclusion of detailed constraints and resolution logic.
By leveraging `pyproject.toml`, Poetry enables finer control over dependency versions, ensuring precise management and resolution.

Where pip traditionally installs packages globally, potentially leading to conflicts or dependency mismatches,
Poetry offers a more sophisticated approach. With Poetry, the creation and management of virtual environments are seamlessly integrated into the workflow,
ensuring that each project operates within its isolated environment.
This practice not only fosters consistency but also mitigates potential conflicts, providing a reliable foundation for development and deployment.

Furthermore, achieving seamless packaging and distribution of Python projects is not feasible with pip alone;
additional tooling and manual steps are typically required such as the usage of `setuptools`. Unlike Poetry, which provides built-in functionality for packaging projects,
pip lacks native support for creating distributable packages. Without the aid of additional tools or scripts,
developers using pip would need to resort to manual processes to package their projects, adding complexity and overhead to the development workflow.

Key features of Poetry:

- Centralized dependency management using `pyproject.toml`.
- Dependency resolution and lock files.
- Virtual environment management.
- Simplified package workflow.
- Versioning and publishing for packages.

While we won't delve into the packaging aspect of Poetry in this post, it's essential to recognize that Poetry offers robust capabilities beyond dependency management.
With Poetry, handling your favorite dependencies such as `numpy`, `pytorch`, and `matplotlib` becomes a seamless experience, thanks to its intuitive interface and powerful features.
By providing a centralized solution for managing dependencies,
Poetry streamlines the development workflow, enabling developers to focus on writing code rather than dealing with dependency issues.
By now, I trust you've discovered the convenience and efficiency that Poetry brings to Python project management! :)

## Installing pyenv

If you're confident that have Python installed efficiently, great you can skip this section! However, if you don't mind taking a quick
detour let's install **pyenv**. Just how _Poetry_ is used to manage our Python project's dependencies, we can use
_pyenv_ to simplify Python version management.

**Why pyenv?**

_pyenv_ simplifies managing multiple Python versions, enabling easy switching between them.
This is particularly useful for projects requiring different Python versions or compatibility testing across various versions.

If you're convinced, let's install pyenv!

### Linux/macOS

Run their automatic installer in your shell:

```bash
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

I'll show you how to setup your shell environment for pyenv so that is available for use. Today, we'll continue with
using `bash` as our shell example. If you're unsure of what shell you have, check by using `echo $SHELL`. In the case it's `bash`, run the
following to modify `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'command -v pyenv >/dev/null || export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

For other shells and optionally adding pyenv to your login shell, please refer to [setting up your shell environment for pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#set-up-your-shell-environment-for-pyenv).

Now you can restart your shell by using `source ~/.bashrc` and then test out your pyenv installation by typing `pyenv`:

```shell
pyenv 2.3.25
Usage: pyenv <command> [<args>]

Some useful pyenv commands are:
--version Display the version of pyenv
activate Activate virtual environment
commands List all available pyenv commands
...
```

If you see something similar to above, we're ready to install python!
Let's install 3.12, which is the latest release at the time of writing this post and configure it as the global version:

```bash
pyenv install 3.12
pyenv global 3.12
pyenv version
```

### Windows

Unfortunately, pyenv does not officially support Windows outside of WSL. However, there is a [pyenv-win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win) fork that may be of interest.

For more information on installing pyenv, checkout their github repo [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).

## Installing Poetry

Regardless of whether or not you installed pyenv (which I recommend you do), we're finally ready to install Poetry!

### Linux/macOS

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

### Windows (Powershell)

```bash
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | py -
```

That's it! You can test out your installation by typing `poetry --version`.

## Example:
